My main interests have been in the intersection of three technical fields: optimization, dynamical systems and control, and machine learning.
One of my recent focuses is on data-driven robust optimization using tools such as probability theory, functional analysis, principled learning and kernel methods. I believe mathematical optimization, with modern stochastic and nonlinear programming, could play an interesting role in many cutting-edge applications such as large-scale machine learning, robust machine learning/reinforcement learning as well as in stochastic control.

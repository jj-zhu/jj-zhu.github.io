# New: open Ph.D. positions

Ph.D. positions in **optimal transport and machine learning**, on topics closely related to theory foundation of OT, computational OT, gradient flows, PDE, deep generative models, Bayesian inference, kernel methods, distributional robustness, generalization, optimization, theory foundation of OT for RL and control

# Qualification
The ideal candidate's background is in  applied math and/or machine learning (e.g. optimization, analysis of PDE/SDE), with **a master's degree and related research experience**. Those qualifications are demonstrated by high-quality technical reports or publications in relevant venues such as mathematical journals of top ML conferences (NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR/AISTATS/UAI/AAAI/CoLT/JMLR/TMLR etc.).

# Examples of topics include

* Optimal transport (and gradient flow) applications in machine learning and optimization
* Analysis of PDE/SDE with ML applications
* Probabilistic machine learning, Bayesian inference, generative models
* Kernel methods, interacting particle systems
* Distributionally robust optimization and control
  

The student will be jointly supervised by Jia-Jie Zhu (KTH Stockholm/TU Darmstadt. Topic: OT, optimization, applied math) and Jan Peters (TU Darmstadt. Topic: RL, robotics/control)

# Application and more details

Inquiries from qualified (see above) candidates are encouraged. Please send the following:

- CV with links to your existing works
- Master's thesis (if any), and any previous tech reports or publications related to the position
- Complete transcripts for both bachelor's and master's,

to the email address [here](mailto:zplusj@gmail.com), with the subject containing [apply-phd-TUDA-KTH].
The position will be open until filled. 

Note that, due to the number of inquiries, we can only reply when there is a fit. Please excuse the delay in response.

# New: open Ph.D. position

We have a fully-funded Ph.D. position in **optimization and machine learning**, on topics closely related to distributional robustness, generalization, optimization transport and kernel methods, gradient flow, large-scale optimization, robustness in RL and control, interfacing robustness and causality or fairness.

# Qualification
The ideal candidate's background is in machine learning and/or optimization, with **a master's degree and related research experience**. Those qualifications are demonstrated by by high-quality technical reports or publications in relevant venues such as (NeurIPS/ICLR/AISTATS/ICML/AAAI/CoLT/ALT/JMLR/STOC etc.). Candidates with strong applied or industrial experiences will also be considered. Inquiry welcome.

# Examples of topics include

* Continuous optimization for machine learning/deep learning/reinforcement learning
* Robust optimization, stochastic optimization
* Optimal transport and gradient flow for machine learning and optimization
* Robustness and generalization in learning with a focus on decision-making
* Dynamical systems modeling and optimization
* Interfacing learning theory and optimization
  
# What we offer

  - Close mentorship: the Ph.D. candidate will receive responsible and careful mentorship.
  - [The Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics (WIAS), Berlin](https://wias-berlin.de/) is a research institution known for its strength in mathematical optimization and dynamical systems, and applied mathematics in general. It has hosted flagship conferences in mathematical optimization, such as ICCOPT 2019. We also envision collaborations with our partners at top institutions.
  - Our office space is located in downtown Berlin. Berlin is one of the most culture-rich and diverse international cities in the world. It offers endless opportunities to enjoy life outside work while being very affordable compared to other major cities. Working here does not require the German language (although we offer free German courses). Scientifically, Berlin offers a rich landscape with numerous opportunities for research, as well as job prospects in academia and industry.
  - There is no teaching duty envisioned.

# New: open Ph.D. position

We have a Ph.D. position in mathematics **optimal transport and robust machine learning**, on topics closely related to computational OT, gradient flows, deep generative models, Bayesian inference, kernel methods, distributional robustness, generalization, optimization, robustness in RL and control, interfacing robustness and causality or fairness.

# Qualification
The ideal candidate's background is in machine learning and/or applied math (e.g. optimization, PDE/SDE), with **a master's degree and related research experience**. Those qualifications are demonstrated by high-quality technical reports or publications in relevant venues such as (NeurIPS/ICLR/AISTATS/ICML/AAAI/CoLT/ALT/JMLR/STOC etc.). Candidates with strong applied or industrial experiences (e.g. deep learning) will also be considered. Inquiry welcome.

# Examples of topics include

* Optimal transport (and gradient flow) applications in machine learning and optimization
* Robust optimization, stochastic optimization
* Robustness and generalization in ML
* Causal inference
* Dynamical systems modeling and optimization
* Interfacing learning theory and optimization
  
# What we offer

  - [The Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics (WIAS), Berlin](https://wias-berlin.de/) is a research institution known for its strength in mathematical optimization and dynamical systems, and applied mathematics in general. It has hosted flagship conferences in mathematical optimization, such as ICCOPT 2019. We also envision collaborations with our partners at top institutions.
  - We are part of the [Berlin Mathematical School](https://www.math-berlin.de/), a joint graduate school of the three major Berlin universities, which offers a vibrant and diverse environment for mathematical research.
  - Our office space is located in downtown Berlin. Berlin is one of the most culture-rich and diverse international cities in the world. It offers endless opportunities to enjoy life outside work while being very affordable compared to other major cities. Working here does not require the German language (although we offer free German courses). Scientifically, Berlin offers a rich landscape with numerous opportunities for research, as well as job prospects in academia and industry.
  - There is no teaching duty envisioned.

# Application and more details

Inquiries from qualified (see above) candidates are encouraged. Please send the following:

- CV with links to your existing works
- Master's thesis (if any), and nny previous tech reports or publications related to the position
- Transcripts for bachelor's and master's,

to the email address [here](mailto:zplusj@gmail.com), with the subject containing [apply-phd-ot].
The position will be open until filled. However, to receive full consideration, please apply (or inquire) as soon as possible. 

Selected candidates will *later* submit a formal application 

- 1-2 page cover letter (including a *very brief* research statement)
- provide contact information of 2-3 references from *previous research projects*, who have agreed to be contacted

Note that due to the number of inquiries, we can only reply when there is a fit. Please excuse the delay in response.

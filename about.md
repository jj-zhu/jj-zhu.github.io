Hi, this is JJ (朱家傑). I grew up in Shanghai, China, where I studied mathematics for my undergraduate degree at Fudan University. Following that, I received doctoral training in numerical analysis and optimization during my Ph.D. study guided by William Hager at the University of Florida. After moving to Europe and being awarded the Marie Curie Individual Fellowship, I learned numerical methods for of robust nonlinear optimization and control from Moritz Diehl during a research stay at the University of Freiburg. Recently, I was a postdoctoral researcher in machine learning at the Empirical Inference Department, Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tübingen, Germany, where I worked on the theory of kernel methods, distributionally robust optimization, and robust machine learning at the group of Bernhard Schölkopf. There, I invented the *Kernel DRO*, which is a kernel-MMD constrained optimization algorithm inspired by the Wasserstein gradient flow. Following that, I start learning principled gradient flow in dynamical systems and optimal transport, and their applications to machine learning and optimization, from the experts in Berlin. In my spare time, I enjoy reading science fiction and hiking.

[Here (in both German and English)](https://jj-zhu.github.io/file/fvb-journal-interview.pdf) is a recent journal interview about my career path.
There is also a previous [article in a magazine interview](https://www.mariecuriealumni.eu/mcaa-magazine/february-2019/innovative-technologies/european-approach-artificial-intelligence).

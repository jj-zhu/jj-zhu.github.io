I am a junior research group leader (equivalent to assistant professor) at the [Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics, Berlin](https://www.wias-berlin.de/). Prior to coming to Berlin, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher in machine learning at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in TÃ¼bingen, Germany. My Ph.D. study was in optimization, with William Hager at the University of Florida. See [here](/about/) for a short bio.

### Research interests

My big goal is to advance research in computational algorithms, in order to change the world for the better. In general, I am interested in **optimization, machine learning, dynamical systems, decision-making, and control**. On one hand, I am motivated by addressing the **lack of robustness and data distribution shift issues** in modern learning algorithms. On the other hand, I am interested in **interfacing dynamical systems (e.g., gradient flow, dynamic optimal transport, control theory) and machine learning**, aiming at building robust and scalable optimization and learning algorithms. Some example topics include

+ machine learning, robust learning under distribution shift
+ distributionally robust optimization, optimization under uncertainty
+ applications of optimal transport, gradient flow, and kernel methods
+ numerical optimization, numerical methods
+ control, multi-stage decision-making
+ data-driven modeling of dynamical systems and physics

See [here](/research/) for more information about research topics.

I also write [a non-research blog here](https://jj-zhu.github.io/blog/). Though the frequency of updates depends on how busy I am at the moment.

I am a junior research group leader (similar to an assistant professor in North America) heading the Data-driven Optimization and Control Group, [Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics, Berlin](https://www.wias-berlin.de/). 
I am also an affiliated researcher with the [Empirical Inference Department, Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, TÃ¼bingen](https://ei.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/).

### Research interests

In general, I am an *applied mathematician* interested in **optimization, machine learning (with a focus on distributional robustness), function spaces, dynamical systems, and control**. My group focuses on the mathematical optimization foundations for machine learning, dynamical systems, and control algorithms, and, more broadly, data-driven algorithmic decision-making. We are especially motivated by addressing the **lack of robustness and data distribution shift issues** in modern learning algorithms, as well as interfacing dynamical systems and machine learning.

+ machine learning, robust learning under distribution shift, kernel methods
+ distributionally robust optimization, optimization under uncertainty
+ control, dynamical systems modeling
+ numerical optimization, numerical analysis

See [here](/research/) for more information about research topics.

I also write [a non-researchy blog here](https://jj-zhu.github.io/blog/). Though the frequency of updates depends on how busy I am at the moment.

### Research interests

In general, I am an *applied mathematician* interested in **optimization, machine learning (with a focus on distributional robustness), function spaces, dynamical systems, and control**. My group focuses on the *mathematical optimization foundations for machine learning, dynamical systems, and control algorithms, and, more broadly, data-driven algorithmic decision-making. We are especially motivated by addressing the lack of robustness and data distribution shift issues in modern learning algorithms, as well as interfacing dynamical systems and machine learning*.


+ Machine learning, kernel methods, robust learning under distribution shift
+ Distributionally robust optimization, stochastic optimization
+ Dynamical systems, control, multi-stage decision-making
+ Numerical optimization, numerical analysis

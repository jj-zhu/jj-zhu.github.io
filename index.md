I am a junior research group leader (similar to assistant professor in North America) at the Data-driven Optimization and Control Group, [Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics, Berlin](https://www.wias-berlin.de/). 
I am also an affiliated researcher at the [Empirical Inference Department, Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, TÃ¼bingen](https://ei.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/).

### **Positions and Opportunities**:

- [Filled] ~~Ph.D. position in Berlin, Germany on robust machine learning and robust optimization~~
- [Accepting applications] [Postdoc position at Weierstrass Institute, Berlin, the intersection of mathematical optimization, machine learning, optimal control](/postdoc_1/)
- Additional funding opportunities: 
  - [Joint PhD project in statistical learning with other WIAS groups](https://wias-berlin.softgarden.io/job/13158792?l=de)
  - [BMS Dirichlet Postdoctoral Fellowships](https://math-berlin.de/bms-faculty/dirichlet-postdoctoral-program)
  - [BMS PhD funding](https://math-berlin.de/application)

### I write [a blog here](https://jj-zhu.github.io/blog/). Though the freqency of updates depends on how busy I am at the moment.

### Research interests

In general, I am an *applied mathematician* interested in **optimization, machine learning (with a focus on distributional robustness), function spaces, dynamical systems, and control**. My group focuses on the *mathematical optimization foundations for machine learning, dynamical systems, and control algorithms, and, more broadly, data-driven algorithmic decision-making. We are especially motivated by addressing the lack of robustness and data distribution shift issues in modern learning algorithms, as well as interfacing dynamical systems and machine learning*.


+ Machine learning, kernel methods, robust learning under distribution shift
+ Distributionally robust optimization, stochastic optimization
+ Dynamical systems, control, multi-stage decision-making
+ Numerical optimization, numerical analysis, numerical optimal control

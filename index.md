I am a Weierstrass research group leader heading the Data-driven Optimization and Control group, [Weierstrass Institute, Berlin](https://www.wias-berlin.de/). I am also an affiliated researcher with the [Empirical Inference Department](https://ei.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/), [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, TÃ¼bingen](http://is.tue.mpg.de/).

My group focuses on the *mathematical foundations and applications of algorithmic decision-making using data-driven optimization & control, especially on robustness under data distribution shift, interfacing dynamical systems and machine learning*.

**Positions and Opportunities**:

- [Filled] ~~Ph.D. position in Berlin, Germany on robust machine learning and robust optimization~~
- [Postdoc position at Weierstrass Institute, Berlin, the intersection of mathematical optimization, machine learning, optimal control](/postdoc_1/)
- Coming soon
- Other funding opportunities in Berlin: [BMS Dirichlet Postdoctoral Fellowships](https://math-berlin.de/bms-faculty/dirichlet-postdoctoral-program), [BMS PhD](https://math-berlin.de/application)

### I write [a blog here](https://jj-zhu.github.io/blog/).

### Research interests

In general, I am an *applied mathematician* interested in **optimization, machine learning (with a focus on distributional robustness), function spaces, dynamical systems, and control**. More specifically, I am interested in the following technical topics.

+ Machine learning, robust learning under distribution shift, kernel methods
+ Distributionally robust optimization, stochastic optimization
+ Dynamical systems, control, multi-stage decision-making
+ Numerical optimization, numerical analysis

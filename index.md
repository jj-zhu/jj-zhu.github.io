I am a junior research group leader (equivalent to assistant professor) leading the Data-driven Optimization and Control Group, at the [Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics, Berlin](https://www.wias-berlin.de/). Prior to coming to Berlin, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher in machine learning at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in TÃ¼bingen, Germany. My Ph.D. study was in optimization, with William Hager at the University of Florida.

### Research interests

In general, I am interested in **optimization, machine learning, dynamical systems, decisions, and control**. My group focuses on the mathematical optimization, machine learning, dynamical systems modeling, and control / decision-making. On one hand, we are motivated by addressing the **lack of robustness and data distribution shift issues** in modern learning algorithms. On the other hand, I am interested in interfacing dynamical systems and machine learning, aiming at building scalable computational algorithms for optimization and machine learning. Some example topics include

+ machine learning, robust learning under distribution shift
+ distributionally robust optimization, optimization under uncertainty
+ applications of optimal transport, gradient flow, and kernel methods
+ numerical optimization, numerical methods
+ control, multi-stage decision-making
+ data-driven modeling of dynamical systems and physics

See [here](/research/) for more information about research topics.

I also write [a non-research blog here](https://jj-zhu.github.io/blog/). Though the frequency of updates depends on how busy I am at the moment.

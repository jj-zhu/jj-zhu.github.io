I am an independent research group leader (equivalent to assistant professor) at the [Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics, Berlin](https://www.wias-berlin.de/). Prior to coming to Berlin, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher in machine learning at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in TÃ¼bingen, Germany. My Ph.D. study was in optimization, with William Hager at the University of Florida. See [here](/about/) for a short bio. 
I also write [a non-research blog here](https://jj-zhu.github.io/blog/). Though the frequency of updates depends on how busy I am at the moment.

### **Positions and opportunities**:

- Open [postdoc](postdoc_1) and [Ph.D. position in **optimization and machine learning**](phd_2)
- Other funding opportunities in Berlin: [BMS PhD funding](https://math-berlin.de/application)

### News and updates
- Sep 2022. [Here are the slides](https://jj-zhu.github.io/file/Eindhoven-OT-workshop-2022-Zhu.pdf) for a recent talk I gave at the OT workshop at TU Eindhoven.
- Aug 2022. [Here (in both German and English)](https://jj-zhu.github.io/file/fvb-journal-interview.pdf) is a recent journal interview about my career path.
- Jul 2022. A few new publications at ICML and IEEE-CDC continuing previous works on kernel methods for robust optimization and control with a few talented PhD students I work with. We are pushing a series of works of kernel learning machines for optimization and inference. The hope is to trail-blaze a branch of research that use modern learning machines for robustly optimizing learning and control systems.  
[ICML paper on conditional moment problems for ML and causal inference](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/kremer22a/kremer22a.pdf)  
[IEEE CDC paper on distributionally robust chance-constraint nonlinear optimization (preprint)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.11564.pdf)  
[IEEE CDC paper on learning uncertain-aware dyanmics with large-scale kernel machines (preprint)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.13066.pdf)  

- Jul 2022. I'm teaching a minicourse for the TU Berlin-Oxford IRTG Stochastic Analysis Ph.D. program. See [exercise files and lecture notes](/teaching/).

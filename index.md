I am a research group leader at the [Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics, Berlin](https://www.wias-berlin.de/).
Prior to Berlin, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher in machine learning at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tübingen, Germany. My Ph.D. study was in numerical optimization, at the University of Florida. See [here](/about/) for a short bio. 
I also write [a non-research blog here](https://jj-zhu.github.io/blog/). Though the frequency of updates depends on how busy I am at the moment.

My group focuses on research in state-of-the-art machine learning and optimization, in algorithm, theory, and large-scale computation.
Specifically, I started my research career in numerical optimization, and was interested in the robustness theory for machine learning. That requires us to use computational tools such as **optimization algorithms over probability distributions**, which are infinite-dimensional.
For example, in some of my previous works, I invented [robust learning algorithms that can protect against distribution shifts using principled kernel methods](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06981.pdf).
Those optimization algorithms in fact have deep theoretical roots in dynamical system theory such as PDEs.
Following that and after moving to Berlin, I dedicate my current research to *interfacing large-scale computational algorithms in machine learning/optimization with dynamical systems theory such as (PDE) grandiet flows and optimal transport*.

I am a Weierstrass research group leader heading the Data-driven Optimization and Control research group, [Weierstrass Institute, Berlin](https://www.wias-berlin.de/). I am also an affiliated researcher with the [Empirical Inference Department](https://ei.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/), [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, Tübingen](http://is.tue.mpg.de/).

My group focuses on the *mathematical foundations and applications of machine learning and data-driven optimization & control, especially on distributional robustness and interfacing dynamical systems and learning*.

**Positions available**:

- [Ph.D. position in Berlin, Germany on robust machine learning and robust optimization](/phd_1/)
- Coming soon

### I write [a blog here](https://jj-zhu.github.io/blog/).

### Research interests

In general, I am an *applied mathematician* interested in **optimization, machine learning (with a focus on distributional robustness), function spaces, dynamical systems, and control**. More specifically, I am interested in the following technical topics.

+ Machine learning, robust learning under distribution shift, kernel methods
+ Distributionally robust optimization, stochastic optimization
+ Dynamical systems, control, multi-stage decision-making
+ Numerical optimization, numerical analysis

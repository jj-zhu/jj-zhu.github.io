I am a research group leader at the [Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics, Berlin](https://www.wias-berlin.de/).
Prior to Berlin, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher in machine learning at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tübingen, Germany. My Ph.D. study was in numerical optimization, at the University of Florida. See [here](/about/) for a short bio. 
I also write [a non-research blog here](https://jj-zhu.github.io/blog/). Though the frequency of updates depends on how busy I am at the moment.

My group focuses on research in state-of-the-art machine learning and optimization, in algorithm, theory, and large-scale computation.
Specifically, I started my research career in numerical optimization, and was interested in the robustness theory for machine learning. That requires us to use computational tools such as **optimization algorithms over probability distributions**, which are infinite-dimensional.
For example, in some of my previous works, I invented [robust learning algorithms that can protect against distribution shifts using principled kernel methods](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06981.pdf).
Those optimization algorithms in fact have deep theoretical roots in dynamical system theory such as PDEs.
Following that and after moving to Berlin, I dedicate my current research to *interfacing large-scale computational algorithms in machine learning/optimization with dynamical systems theory such as (PDE) gradient flows and optimal transport*.

### News and updates
- I will be teaching the [nonparametric statistics course at Humboldt University of Berlin (at master level)](https://agnes.hu-berlin.de/lupo/rds?state=verpublish&status=init&vmfile=no&publishid=207589&moduleCall=webInfo&publishConfFile=webInfo&publishSubDir=veranstaltung), co-lecturing with Vladimir Spokoinyi, in term 2023/24. More information coming soon.
- I will teach a mini-course on optimization and dynamics, introducing (beginner-friendly) concepts of gradient flows from the optimization perspective at the [International Workshop of Intelligent Autonomous Learning Systems 2023](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Workshops/IWIALS2023). The lecture notes will be available here.
- July 2023. I gave an invited talk at the [ICML 2023 Workshop on Duality Principles for Modern Machine Learning](https://dp4ml.github.io/). The slides are available [here](https://jj-zhu.github.io/file/duality-ICML-2023-Zhu.pdf).
- July 2023. Accepted paper at CDC 2023: [Propagating Kernel Ambiguity Sets in Nonlinear Data-driven Dynamics Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14057)
    - In this paper, I discovered the ambiguity set and geometric structure that can be propagated in nonlinear data-driven dynamics models. This is the first algorithm that can quantify the uncertainty of uncertainty -- the ambiguity of data-driven Koopman operators and kernel conditional mean embedding models.
- June 2023. Heiner Kremer and Yassine Nemmour gave talks on their works in kernel methods and DRO at the Mini-Symposiums at the SIAM Conference on Optimization 2023 in Seattle, Washington.
- May 2023. Accepted paper at ICML 2023 [(link to preprint)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10898): Heiner Kremer, Yassine Nemmour, Bernhard Sch ̈olkopf, and Jia-Jie Zhu. Estimation Beyond Data Reweighting: Kernel Method of Moments.
- May 2023. A couple of new preprints are available:
    - [Nonlinear Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07415)
    - [Propagating Kernel Ambiguity Sets in Nonlinear Data-driven Dynamics Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14057)
- Apr 2023. Gave a plenary talk at the Leibniz Institute for Agricultural Engineering and Bioeconomy Potsdam, during the workshop "Mathematical Modeling and Simulation" (MMS) Days.
- Served as area chair for AISTATS 2023.  
- Sep 2022. [Here are the slides](https://jj-zhu.github.io/file/Eindhoven-OT-workshop-2022-Zhu.pdf) for a recent talk I gave at the OT workshop at TU Eindhoven.
- Aug 2022. [Here (in both German and English)](https://jj-zhu.github.io/file/fvb-journal-interview.pdf) is a recent journal interview about my career path.

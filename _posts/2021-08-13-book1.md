title: Some random books I loved
---

Upon the mention from a friend, here are some random books I enjoyed:
- [Antifragile](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13530973-antifragile): Taleb's version of [the optimizer's guide to the good life](https://jj-zhu.github.io/blog/). This installment in his book series populated what he called the "barbell strategy" to decision-making. It's a pretty interesting heuristic.
- [The Three-Body Problem by Liu Cixin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20518872-the-three-body-problem): This mind-bloooowing trilogy makes me think about why we live as a species, generations after generations, and how much our civilization has left in the tank. I read the Chinese version, obviously, but I also heard great things about the English version.
- [The Evolution Of Desire by David Buss](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27491.The_Evolution_Of_Desire): A rational view of love and desire.
- [Your Money or Your Life by Vicki Robin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78428.Your_Money_or_Your_Life): It's like robust optimization applied to personal finance. It's about saving money and our freedom. I love the analogy that good financial habits are like a dam, storing your life's energy to one day power truly important things in life.

Looking forward to:
- [The Practice of Groundedness by Brad Stulberg](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56293870-the-practice-of-groundedness): I like the fusion of periodization from sports training and achieving our goals in career and life.
- [Verissimus by Donald Robertson](https://donaldrobertson.name/verissimus/): a graphic novel about the Stoic Marcus Aurelius. Also, his audiobook version of [How to Think Like a Roman Emperor](https://www.amazon.com/How-to-Think-Like-Roman-Emperor-audiobook/dp/B07F9YYR62/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) is like a therapist whispering to you in a soothing Scottish accent.

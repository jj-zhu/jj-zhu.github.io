title: A regularized approach to optimize your life
---

Recently, accompanying the pandemic, there is a new trend of the so-called anti-optimization movements targeting the ever-more-burning-out knowledge workers.

While I immensely enjoyed the book such as [this](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54785515-four-thousand-weeks) and the [slow-productivity concept](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2021/04/07/on-slow-productivity-and-the-anti-busyness-revolution/), I want to make an important distinction, that many in the productivity space seem to have misunderstood what optimization is. In my previous posts, I made clear that we, as decision-makers in our lives, are responsible for defining the "optimization problem". Now, I want to propose a **regularized approach to optimizing one's life**. (Machine learners know the importance of [regularization](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-86664-8_5).)

**An example.** We may view our decision-making system in life as to solve
$$
\operatorname{minimize} \Bigg\{\mathrm{ Optimization\_objective} + \mathrm{Overhead}\Bigg\}.
$$
In this framework, productivity addicts that fanatically optimize their morning routine are clearly not making the best decision --- since doing so will trigger a huge *overhead*! You can then equally swap the *overhead* piece with *time-with-loved-ones, sanity, well-being*. In this way, optimization is not about losing sight of what's essential, but about having a clear purpose when designing your life such that well-being is a huge factor of decision-making, rather than maximizing the amount of trivial work done.
